My client desire a web-based version on their games which is accessibility across multiple platforms. The requriedments include such as:
Enabling games with multiple teams; as well as implementing unque searchable game and names.
Suportingmultiple players per team or games; as well as the application able to ported mobile platforms to web based platforms.
they aslo needed security based documentsaccording to software.
Basically they wanted me to design the successful mobile game to web platforms which is requirerd a design that could provide players smoothe exprieances with multi-user interaction, maintain data, and its integrity.
        What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
For the particularly documentation, I think we did a thorough job researching the options that served the interests of the my clients. it is very cricual no to let any bias get into me when making recommendations since the clients have his needs. The research and as I provided shows the clients that their best interests is core product.
         What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The SDT is helful when I developing the code, it basically guid for what need to be accomplished. It ensures you are making best use of the time and resources as you are not maintaning what client want; the needs for our clients are clearly defined and we agreed upon.
        If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If i able to choose to revise part of my work it would be the section rrelated to error handling and edge case. Because i addressed common scenarios or a more comprehensive expporation of unnotices errors. How hte systems responds to them all enchance document robustness.
        How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
        The user needs also part of pivotal in shaping the software design and understanding the clients business model with their targets audience; and meet their expectations allowed me to design features that directly related to their customers. We will be priortizing user needs ensured that the final products would be intuitive which is adopted successfully.
        How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
        I have to understand what my clients want and what are the clients requirements, conducting user research and emplying iterative design techniques. My focused on creating a user-centered design uasbility test, incorporating feedback to refine the software design. I would futher enchance my design skilled by exploring UX/UI and invloving end-user in the design process through testing and feedback sessions.
